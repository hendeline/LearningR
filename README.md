Line Sahlholdt Hansen, PhD student

usethis::use_git_ignore(c("*.html", "*_files/"))

Dette er en test. Jeg skal øve at pushe ting til github. 

# LearningR:

TODO: Give a brief description of what your project is about

This project...

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, docs and R folders.

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`:
-   `docs/`:
-   `R/`:

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the
`LearningR.Rproj` file and running this command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

# Resource

For more information on this folder and file workflow and setup, check
out the [prodigenr](https://rostools.github.io/prodigenr) online
documentation.
